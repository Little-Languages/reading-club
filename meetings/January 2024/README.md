# January 2024

In our first meetup, we plan to read a paper called ["Synchronous Languages and Reactive System Design"](https://github.com/Little-Languages/reading-club/blob/main/meetings/January%202024/Synchronous%20Languages%20and%20Reactive%20System%20Design%20-%20Albert%20Benveniste.pdf) by Albert Benveniste from 1998. Additional we reference Nicolas Halbwachs notes on the paper called ["Synchronous programming of reactive systems"](https://github.com/Little-Languages/reading-club/blob/main/meetings/January%202024/Synchronous%20programming%20of%20reactive%20systems%20-%20Nicolas%20Halbwachs.pdf). These papers touch in three synchronous langauges that emerged during the 80's to address how to robustly and performantly implement reactive systems in large industrial applications. These languages include ESTEREL, LUSTRE, and SIGNAL.
