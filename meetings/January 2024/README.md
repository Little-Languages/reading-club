# January 2024

In our first meetup, we plan to read a paper called ["Synchronous Languages and Reactive System Design"](https://github.com/Little-Languages/reading-club/blob/main/meetings/January%202024/Synchronous%20Languages%20and%20Reactive%20System%20Design%20-%20Albert%20Benveniste.pdf) by Albert Benveniste from 1998. Additional we reference Nicolas Halbwachs notes on the paper called ["Synchronous programming of reactive systems"](https://github.com/Little-Languages/reading-club/blob/main/meetings/January%202024/Synchronous%20programming%20of%20reactive%20systems%20-%20Nicolas%20Halbwachs.pdf).
