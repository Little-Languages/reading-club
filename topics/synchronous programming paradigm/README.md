# January 2024

In our first meetup, we plan to talk about the synchronpus programming paradigm that emerged during the 80's to address how to robustly and performantly implement reactive systems in large industrial applications. These languages include ESTEREL, LUSTRE, and SIGNAL. Materials include a paper called ["Synchronous Languages and Reactive System Design"](https://github.com/Little-Languages/reading-club/blob/main/meetings/01-2024/Synchronous%20Languages%20and%20Reactive%20System%20Design%20-%20Albert%20Benveniste.pdf) by Albert Benveniste from 1998 and Nicolas Halbwachs' notes on the former paper called ["Synchronous programming of reactive systems"](https://github.com/Little-Languages/reading-club/blob/main/meetings/01-2024/Synchronous%20programming%20of%20reactive%20systems%20-%20Nicolas%20Halbwachs.pdf).
